IRC interface for Minecraft Server Multiplexer

Requires Flippeh's python library, available at:
	http://code.google.com/p/minecraftadmin/

Set the IRC settings you want in the appropriate lines in mc_irc.py, and run it.

Presently all it does is connect to IRC and a multiplexer, and bark IRC I/O at you.

In all honesty, this is custom-built for the server I run personally, so some of the commands may not make a terrible lot of sense.
