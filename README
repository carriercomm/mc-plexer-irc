IRC interface for Minecraft Server Multiplexer

Requires Flippeh's python library, available at:
	http://code.google.com/p/minecraftadmin/

Set the IRC settings you want in the IRC class definition in  mc.irc.py and run it.

Presently all it does is connect to IRC and a multiplexer, and bark IRC I/O at you.
